# Rails Kickoff â€“ Tailwind

A rapid Rails 6 application template for personal use. This particular template utilizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. Adds webpacker Version 6
and tailwind 2.0.x

Tailwind depends on Webpack so this also comes bundled with [webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) support.

Inspired heavily by [Jumpstart](https://github.com/excid3/jumpstart) from [Chris Oliver](https://twitter.com/excid3/). Credits to him for a bunch here.

### Tailwind CSS by default

With Rails 6 we have webpacker by default now. Using PostCSS we can install Tailwind as a base CSS framework to harness. I prefer Tailwind due to it's un-opinionated approach.

## How it works

When creating a new rails app simply pass the template file through.

### Creating a new app

```bash
$ rails new sample_app -d <postgresql, mysql, sqlite3> -m template.rb
```

### Once installed what do I get?

- Webpack support + Tailwind CSS configured in the `app/javascript` directory.
- A custom scaffold view template when generating theme resources (Work in progress).
- Git initialization out of the box
- PurgeCSS configuration to help with CSS file sizes

### Boot it up

`$ rails server`
